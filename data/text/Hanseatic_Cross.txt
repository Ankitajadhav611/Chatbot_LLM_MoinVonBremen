You may notice the distinctive paving on Bremen's market square. Here you can see a Hanseatic cross that was originally emblazoned on the flags of the Hanseatic Legion. The Hanseatic Legion was made up of citizens from Bremen, Hamburg and LÃ¼beck and fought together in the wars of liberation from 1813 to 1815. The cross, which is paved in red and measures 4.8 metres in diameter, is a reminder of this legion.
