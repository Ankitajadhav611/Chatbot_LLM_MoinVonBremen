The Neustadt Lights

Art, culture and culinary treats
The Neustadt Lights return, offering art, culture, music, food and mulled wine. This is your chance to discover imaginative and unusual gift ideas from exhibitors and creative stalls that change on a daily basis. The spacious, brightly lit yurts are a bit different from the normal Christmas market stalls. On offer are handcrafted products and one-off textile, jewellery and design pieces. In addition to a wide range of children’s activities, the entertainment consists of a variety of cultural events featuring street performers, theatre, readings, workshops and live music, plus lots of other surprises. Come along and experience the Neustadt district in a very special way, through activities, encounters and cultural exchange."
