You hear animal voices on the market square? Barking, crows, cock-a-doodle-do or IA cries can be heard alternately from the so-called Bremer Loch - Hole of Bremen. The reason: a manhole cover next to the Bürgerschaft has been converted into a donation box. If you insert a coin, you will receive the sound of one of the four town musicians as a reward. The coins are donated to the Wilhelm-Kaisen-Bürgerhilfe for its social projects.
