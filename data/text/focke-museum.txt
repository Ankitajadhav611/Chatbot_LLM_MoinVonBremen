Bremen State Museum of Art and Cultural History
As a state museum for art and cultural history, the Focke Museum offers a comprehensive insight into Bremen's history. The museum's buildings form a unique ensemble in a spacious park: the transparent main building, the cubic display storeroom and the four historic houses from different eras. The mill in Oberneuland is also part of the Focke Museum.

The Focke Museum, which is over 100 years old, is characterized by the variety of themes on display. From the Stone Age to the 20th century, original objects tell of Bremen's past and cultural history.

The themes of the permanent exhibitions range from the city's history to shipping and trade, industry and work, rural life and bourgeois living culture, applied and fine art, Bremen silver and European glass, and archaeology. Children's lives and historical toys can be seen in the interactive children's museum.

Please note: The Focke Museum is renewing its collection exhibition on the city's history. Due to renovation work and the redesign of the exhibition, the main building and the exhibition storeroom will be closed until the end of 2026.
