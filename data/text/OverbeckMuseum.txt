Overbeck Museum
The Overbeck Museum in the listed Old Packhouse in Vegesack is dedicated to the estate of the Worpswede artist couple Fritz and Hermine Overbeck. The works of the two painters are shown all year round in different selections, and in the context of quarterly special exhibitions by other artists, also in direct comparison with thematically related and contemporary art.
Guided tours, lectures and art trips accompany the exhibition program. A special focus is on the museum's educational work. Offers for children and young people from preschool age onwards invite them to get to know art in more depth and also discover their own creativity. The Overbeck Museum maintains cooperation with schools and kindergartens and offers free admission for all children and young people up to 18 years of age.
