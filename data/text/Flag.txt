The flag of Bremen (used by both the city of Bremen, Germany, and the state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, Germany) consists of at least eight equal horizontal stripes of red alternating with white, and checked at the hoist. It is colloquially known as Speckflagge (bacon flag). The civil flag does not contain the coat of arms.
The state flag exists in three versions

The Dienstflagge, which is defaced with the middle coat of arms.
The Staatsflagge, which is defaced with the flag version of the coat of arms and usually has twelve instead of eight stripes.
The Dienstflagge der bremischen Schiffahrt, which is defaced with the flag version of the coat of arms in the centre and a blue anchor in a white canton. It is used on state buildings used for shipping and navigation, and as the jack on Bremen ships.
