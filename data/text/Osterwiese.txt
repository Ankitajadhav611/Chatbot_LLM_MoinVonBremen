Osterwiese - Bremen's Spring Fun Fair
The beginning of spring brings not only warmer weather and longer days to Bremen – it also brings the Osterweise: The most famous fair in northern Germany.
Every year, one week before the holiday Karfreitag, Bremen’s biggest spring festival begins: the Osterwiese. There’s tons of attractions and plenty of delicious things to eat, providing the whole family with a guaranteed good time. The numerous rides, booths, and stands ensure there is something for everyone to enjoy themselves. It’s over 50,000 square metres of pure fun! About 500.000 visitors enjoy this event year after year.
Around 200 carneys ensure that an amazing time is had by all. Every year new attractions, as well as old favourites, come to the fairground, providing variety and amusement for old and young. Whether your thing is riding the giant Ferris wheel, visiting the haunted house, or the trying out the Breakdancer ride, everyone will enjoy themselves at the Osterwieser.
The Osterwiese offers an amazing day out for the entire family. Take the day and explore the rides, raffle booths, and games of chance and skill. And if you get lucky, perhaps you’ll even see the Easter bunny hop by.
