The festival Musikfest Bremen was founded in 1989 by Prof. Thomas Albert and is since then a highlight of the cultural life every August and September in the Hanseatic city and selected venues all over north-western Germany. Its continuous shifting between old and contemporary music, between orchestral and chamber music, between tradition and avant-garde leads to a multifaceted, kaleidoscopic festival-program and is likewise reflected in the invited artists. Established artists next to shooting stars and youngsters make guest appearances at the festival, with their insights into the latest developments of the international music scene for discussion. Many programs and artists constellations can only exclusively be experienced throughout Germany at the Musikfest Bremen."
