"Set between the town hall and the State Parliament, the cathedral completes the ensemble of historical buildings on Bremen's market square. Its two towers, one of which is open to visitors, are visible from afar and dominate the city skyline. Over the centuries, the cathedral has often changed its face. A visit to the cathedral museum or a climb up one of the over 90-metre-high towers is worthwhile!

An Impressive Sight
Bremen's St. Peter's Cathedral is an impressive building on Bremen's market square. A church has stood on this site for over 1200 years. The first wooden cathedral was built in 789 by the Saxon bishop Willehad and replaced by a stone building around 805. After being destroyed and rebuilt several times, the three-nave basilica was built in the 11th century, which provided the basic structure of today's Bremen Cathedral.

Today, St. Peter's Cathedral is an impressive church. The southern of the two over 90-metre-high church towers can be climbed and offers an incredible view over Bremen. Guided tours of the cathedral take place every Wednesday and on the first Sunday of the month."
