School Museum Bremen
In a school building dating back to 1904, visitors of all ages can experience Bremen's school history. Old school desks, fascinating physical equipment, plaster models of the human body, animal specimens, colorful murals, historical photographs, class registers, certificates, gym equipment, handicrafts: over 32,000 objects and a library with around 30,000 books are the treasures that form the basis for examining Bremen's pedagogy of the last 150 years.
Museum educational programs invite visitors to experience everyday school life and life in the imperial era. Special programs for children on the topic of childhood and youth during National Socialism provide a look at the Nazi era from the personal memories of contemporary witnesses from Bremen. The authentic earth bunker from 1941 and the section "Hunger-Democracy-Rock 'n' Roll - Childhood and Youth after 1945" present other important times from a child's perspective.
