Bremen for Night Owls
There are many things to experience in Bremen by night: going on a pub tour with friends in the 'Viertel' district, enjoying an evening out in a stylish bar, or dancing the night away at a trendy club on the 'disco mile'.
Whether wild dance nights in a large disco, hearty pub evenings in a rustic ambience or cocktails with a lounge feeling - Bremen's nightlife has something to suit every taste!
The Viertel - The Place to be for Pub Crawlers
The quarter comprises the Ostertor and Steintor districts and is "THE" trendy quarter of Bremen. During the day and in the evenings, many small caf√©s and restaurants invite you to linger and stroll. At weekends and on so-called "Student Thursday", the streetscape is transformed into a colourful hustle and bustle of night owls and partygoers. Here you will find a multitude of bars that guarantee you a damp, happy party.
