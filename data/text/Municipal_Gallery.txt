The Städtische Galerie Bremen – on approx. 1000 sqm current Bremen art positions, artist support and an incredible art treasure

Since 1991, the Städtische Galerie Bremen has offered an extensive exhibition program that presents the diversity of the Bremen art scene, reflects international developments in contemporary art and regularly produces outstanding artistic positions with a socio-political claim.

In the large, open rooms of the former Remmer brewery, located directly on the Kleine Weser, the house welcomes everyone to visit and marvel at the four to six exhibitions per year, with free admission. Through its involvement in the art funding of the Senator for Culture, the Bremen Municipal Gallery presents the exhibition for the "Bremen Promotion Prize for Fine Arts" once a year, providing a platform for young artists and thus new trends in contemporary art. In addition, the exhibition activity focuses on group exhibitions in which Bremen positions are brought together with international artists under thematic aspects. Important artists from Bremen are also honored at regular intervals in solo exhibitions.

As one of the largest art houses in the city, the Städtische Galerie Bremen also manages the Hanseatic City of Bremen's very extensive collection of regional art. It comprises around 6,000 works from the post-war period, with a focus on the period between 1984 and 2004, when the "Social Artists' Support" program awarded numerous one-year scholarships to Bremen artists, who then donated a selected work created in that year to the city's collection.
