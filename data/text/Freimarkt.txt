Freimarkt (lit. Free Fair) in Bremen, Germany, first held in 1035, is one of the oldest fairs in Germany. With more than four million visitors each year, it is also considered to be the biggest funfairs in Northern Germany.
It is celebrated for 17 days in the last two weeks of October, somewhat extended from Friday to Sunday. The area covers approximately 100,000 square meters on two areas: the so-called "Kleiner Freimarkt" (lit. Small Free Fair) on the market square, and the main area at the "BÃ¼rgerweide" adjacent to the Main Station and the Exhibition Center.
The highlight is the "Freimarktsumzug" (lit. Free Fair Procession) held on the second Saturday of the festival. The traditional exclamation for the Freimarkt days, which is also referred to as the "fifth season", is: "Ischa Freimaak!", which can be translated as "It's Freimarkt!".
