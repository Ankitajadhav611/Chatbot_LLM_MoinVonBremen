 1. Introduction. Location. Tourist Information Centre, corner of the Church of Our Beloved Lady. We wish you a warm welcome to Brayman, the handsiatic city on the river, which is over 1200 years old. Brayman, on the River Vesa, is full of history and tales, exciting worlds of knowledge, and varied culture offers. We are delighted to be able to welcome you to our tradition-steeped cosmopolitan city. For your audio stroll on the historic route through Brayman's Old Town, you will need to follow the specially marked out route. This is shown by the silver and bronze coloured marker points on the pavement, which direct you along our tour through the Old Town. And this is how we'll be guiding you around Brayman's attractions. Please cross the tram tracks in front of the Tourist Information Office carefully, and also watch out for the trams. Once you have arrived on the Market Square and have found a suitable place, we'll start our audio guide tour with the history of Brayman. 2. History. Location. Market Square in front of Becksammarkt, Deutsche Haus. We will begin our historic and maritime sightseeing walk with a few details about Bremen. Neighboring towns Bremen and Bremenhaven, which is located 60 km north, are nowadays surrounded and also separated by another German federal state called Loessachsen. Both cities together form the smallest German state. The pursuit of independence was always of the utmost important for the people of Bremen. In 787 Bremen was established as a diocese under Charles the Great. Around 200 years later, Emperor Charles Otto I granted Bremen market privilege, so the town could develop into a centre of trade. The market settlement turned into a city. In order to preserve its independence, Bremen became a member of the Hanseatic League in 1358, the powerful alliance of cities ranging from Flanders to the Baltic area. Finally, the Imperial immediacy authenticated by the Linz Diploma of 1646 constitutionally confirmed Bremen's autonomy and independence. From then on, Bremen was a free imperial city. From 1806, with the dissolving of the old German Empire, Bremen was regarded as an independent sovereign free state and called itself the free and Hanseatic town of Bremen. In 1871, Bremen became a federal state of the new German Reich. After briefly losing its independence under the National Socialists, Bremen was re-established together with Bremerhaven as an independent federal state in 1947. Nowadays, Bremen is the 10th biggest city in Germany and has around 548,000 residents. It stretches in a long shape along both sides of the Weser River and is around 38 kilometres long and 16 kilometres wide. This means that Bremen has the lowest population density of all large German cities. Bremen's coat of arms is very well known. Maybe you've seen it already in a slightly modified form on a bottle of Bex beer, the worldwide renowned beer from Bremen. A special feature is the silver Bremen Gothic key on a red background. The key is the symbol of Peter the Apostle, the patron of Bremen's Cathedral. It is also interpreted as the key to the Kingdom of Heaven. Bremen is a large, modern city with unmistakable charm. Modern worlds of knowledge like the Universal Bremen or the Overseas Museum present science up close and an attractive promenade with ships and restaurants has developed in the heart of the city on the Weser. The varied cultural life of the traditional strong-willed, Hanseatic city gives Bremen its unique character. The Bremen Theatre, the Shakespeare Company or the many museums, such as the Weserborg Museum of Modern Art for example, one of the first German collectors museums. From the staging of musicals to big operas, down to its own theatreship, there's something here for everyone's tastes. Bremen's most important economic sectors are the automobile industry, aerospace technology, logistics, electrical and mechanical engineering, plus the grocery and luxury food industry. Have a look at the inscription on the Deutsches Haus in front of you. In English this is translated as in memory of the brothers who share the fate of our separation. Erected as a gild-hauled café using fragments of old houses taken from the old town, the house that bears this admonitory inscription has been reminiscent of the Division of Germany ever since its reconstruction in 1951. Now please set off for the middle of the market square to the side of the Roland statue. 5. Roland. Location, middle of the market square. Direction of view, to the statue of the Bremer Roland. Nothing illustrates the pursuit of legal and municipal independence more than Bremen's traditional landmark, the Roland. It is one of the oldest statues in Germany, which can still be found on its market square today. In Europe, there were a total of 55 Roland statues, of which 20 survived. The Roland in Bremen is therefore not the only Roland statue in Germany, but the oldest, most representative, most famous, and standing at 5.55 meters tall, is the biggest of the German statues. And together with the town hall, it is on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. But who was Roland? According to the Roland legend, Roland was a margrave from Brittany and was thought to be the nephew or illegitimate son of Emperor Charles the Great. Roland the Hero is said to have saved the army of Charles the Great in a battle against the Basques. The Roland legend originates from the old French song, La Chanson de Roland, from 1100. In 1404, Bremen's town council had the Roland statue built out of limestone, in token of the Bremen patricians claiming lordship over the city. Roland was originally made of wood, but was burned down by mercenary soldiers of the archbishop in 1366. Now, take a closer look at the Roland statue. The youthful cavalier is dressed very much in the fashions of the year 1400. With a tight-fitting leather jerkin over a chainmail shirt, a heavy linked belt, armor-clad knees, splintered legs, and long wavy hair. He is carrying a shield with the double-headed imperial eagle. The shield bears the inscription translated into English, Freedom I proclaim to you, as given forsooth by Charles and many another prince to this city. Thank God for it, this much I advise you. The drawn sword in Roland's hand is regarded as a symbol of justice, for the chief magistrate also sat at the judgment place holding a drawn sword. His long hair is the symbol of a free man, especially the knight, who was the ideal figure of that time. Can you also see the little face between Roland's feet? Legend has it that the countess Emma von Liesem wanted to give the Bremen people a meadow, so big that it would take a man a day to run around it. Herzog Benno, her companion and heir, chose a man without legs, who in the year 1032 used all of his strength to crawl around the Burgervider field, winning the land for the residents. From 1866 the northern part of the Burgervider was turned into a recreational park, which today serves the people of Bremen as a green oasis, and is one of the most important landscape parks in Germany. The distance between Roland's knees is around 55 cm. This corresponds to the historic length measurement of the old Bremer Eller unit of measure. The distance between the knees is said to have been used to measure fabrics in the past. The Bremer Eller is still used to take measurements in science and technology today. This distance is even used internationally as an important special measurement known as LMR, Length Measurement Roland, in special applications in space travel, underwater location or aircraft construction. The head of the Bremen landmark had to be exchanged in the year 1983. The reason for this was air pollution, which had done considerable damage to the statue. The original head can now be found in the Fokker Museum. The Roland statue proudly smiles in the direction of the cathedral, the official seat of the Archbishop, who had a secular claim to power over Bremen. With his defiant look he was said to make the Archbishop realise that the people of Bremen would not take any more orders from him, as according to the inscription on the shield, Emperor Charles had already promised them great freedom. This interpretation sounds plausible, but does not, however, necessarily correspond to the historic facts. Alternatively, one says that Roland is looking in the direction of Hamburger Straße to welcome the merchants coming from the Hanseatic city of Hamburg with Reich freedom and market rights. Legend has it that Bremen will never found her, as long as Roland is still standing. In order to prevent Roland from being damaged, the people of Bremen have fenced him in. The wall built around him during the Second World War even survived the bombs. Rumour has it that the Bremen people also have a replacement Roland in the councillor's cellar of the town hall for emergencies. Only the mayor is said to know where the emergency Roland is kept. Since the very beginning, Roland has been regarded as a landmark and patron saint of the city. Every year on the 5th of November, Roland's birthday is treated like that of a family member. The people of Bremen honour him with flowers. If you turn around, you will be looking directly at an eye-catching modern building, the Bremen House of State Parliament. Look for a suitable place next to the so-called Bremer Loch, a sort of manhole cover in the paving stones of the market square. It can be found on the left next to the House of State Parliament. By the way, if you drop a coin into the slot, you will hear the sounds of the Bremen town musicians. The money is donated to the Wilhelm-Kaizen-Bürgerhilfe aid organisation. 3. Market Square. Location, middle of the Market Square. Direction of view, on the Hanseatic cross down onto the pavement, and also to the houses in the northwest. It is the heart of the city, the Bremen Market Square. This is the place where Bremen was founded. The first people settled here on a former sand dune, and this is where Bremen's history unfolded, around the Market Square. Can you see the pattern incorporated into the cobbles of the marketplace inside the circle of columns? It is designed with darker stones so that a ten-spoked wheel is visible, the centre of which depicts a Hanseatic cross formed with reddish stones. The Hanseatic cross was founded by the Hanseatic cities after 1813 as a badge of honour for the Hanseatic participants of the freedom wars against Napoleon, and then reinstated as a medal in the First World War. Today, it is the most striking ground symbol of the city. Please note that it may be covered up if there are events taking place on the Market Square. Known as one of the most beautiful squares in Europe, the Market Square is a magnet and meeting point for millions of tourists. If you agree that so many people can't all be mistaken, then this square with its historic atmosphere will definitely appeal to you too. In the summer, you can observe the hustle and bustle and watch Bremen's residents and their guests pass by, while enjoying a delicious piece of cake in the outdoor area of the adjoining café. But perhaps it will also be the scene of fun celebrations, like during the Samba Carnival, the La Estrada Street Circus Festival, the Christmas Market, the Free Market, or the Music Festival, when the Market Square shines in all its festive glory. The Bremen Market Square is a work of art of urban planning, which developed from an early medieval trading centre. The square has always belonged to the people who gathered here, whether for exchanging goods or defence. Up until the 18th century, a large part of the public life in Bremen was played out here, on the Market Square. The city fort held its court here under the arcades. Decisions and laws of the town council court, and even death sentences, were pronounced from the balcony of the town hall. Great victories were also celebrated on the square, like after the Thirty Years' War, after the Seven Years' War, after the victory over Napoleon, or the reclamation of the city's own freedom in the year 1814. And still today, fans enjoy celebrating the wins of their football club, Werder Bremen, here. Now, have a look at the building on the north-west side of the Market Square, with the Sparcasse Bank and the Chemist, which can be seen opposite the rear of the Roland statue. These houses are not originals. After they were destroyed during the Second World War, they were converted or rebuilt. So, in 1958, the modern Sparcasse Bank building was hidden behind the Rococo façade of a townhouse. Which was once located on the banks of the Weser. Next to the Sparcasse Bank, on the west side, is the city council's pharmacy from 1896. The elaborate neo-Renaissance decoration of which was the result of a competition to improve the city's appearance. Now, turn to face the right side, in a north-easterly direction. Behind the tram tracks, you will spot the biggest piece de resistance of the Market Square. The magnificent Town Hall, which is more than 600 years old. Here, you will experience fascinating history first-hand. 4. Town Hall. Location, middle of the market square. Direction of view, Town Hall in the North East. The Town Hall was built between 1405 and 1410 as a market and council hall in Gothic style and is the most significant building that the city has ever constructed. The council of the city needed its own house and meeting place for its tasks. The area of the Town Hall therefore also corresponded to the number of citizens who were entitled to vote. 1612. In this year the Bremen master builder, Luder von Bentheim, gave the early Gothic Town Hall building its ornate façade, in the outstanding style of the late Renaissance in North Germany, the so-called Weser Renaissance. And who do you think influenced the architectural forms and façade sculptures? The Dutch architects and sculptors who shared the same beliefs. As one of Germany's most beautiful Town Halls, the ensemble of the old and new buildings, together with the Roland statue opposite, has belonged to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 2004. It is an extraordinary late medieval Town Hall and stands for the municipal freedom of a city republic. As testified by the UNESCO experts, the Town Hall and the Roland of Bremen are a unique testimony to the civic autonomy and political sovereignty which evolved in the Holy Roman Empire. They even highlight the outstanding form of the Weser Renaissance in their reasoning. The eight monumental sculptures on the market façade are also very interesting. Cast a glance at the larger-than-life figures and recognize Emperor Charles the Great and the seven electors on the left. These figures illustrate Bremen's imperial claim to freedom of the Reich, and therefore the city's independence from religious rulers. And what is hidden inside the Town Hall? The two floors are each made up of one Gothic Hall, the lower and the upper halls. In the upper hall of the Town Hall, the Council of the City once got together to make decisions, develop policies and administer justice over the citizens. The upper hall is nowadays a representation hall, with the ostentatious so-called Golden Chamber, and richly furnished with wall paintings, decorated doorways and wooden carvings. It is regarded as Bremen's most beautiful ballroom. The Forbes Veda painter Heinrich Vogler designed the Golden Chamber in 1905, in Art Nouveau style, with lots of images of nature. The lower hall, one of the most beautiful Gothic secular buildings in Germany, is still almost preserved in its original form. The three-aisled hall, supported by octagonal oak wood pillars, has ornamental Gothic doorways in the east and west. It was previously used for market purposes or theatre performances. Nowadays, alternating exhibitions take place here. If you head off in the direction of the Cathedral later on, you can admire the new Town Hall in the back of the old building. Architect Gabriel von Seidel attached the new building in the Neo-Renaissance style as a harmonious extension onto the old Town Hall at the beginning of the 20th century. In the new Town Hall, you can admire, for example, the Gobelin Room, which was named after a large French tapestry from the 17th century and was originally planned as a mayor's room. Today, the room is used as a small reception and consultation room and is also ideal for civil weddings. The Bremen Federal State Parliament holds meetings every week in the Senate Room. The mayor of Bremen is the prime minister of the state and also has his official residence in the Town Hall. If you'd like to find out more about the Town Hall, you can participate in a special Town Hall tour led by the Bremen Tourism Office. Now, turn to face the Roland statue, which was built as a symbol of Hanseatic freedom. 7. Schütting. Location? In front of the Schütting on the market square. Direction of view? Southwest. You are now looking directly at the so-called Schütting. Nowadays the building is home to the Chamber of Commerce. The word Schütting comes from Schossen, which signified the paying of taxes. Between 1537 and 1538 the Antwerp master builder, Johan den Bueschener, constructed the Schütting we know today as a guildhall for Bremen merchants. Built in the Flanders style of the Renaissance buildings, it magnificently complements the town hall and highlights the status and affluence of the merchants in Bremen. The late Gothic West Gable is preserved in its original form. The East Gable, on the other hand, is a wonderful example of the early Renaissance in Bremen. The market front, which you are looking at, was redesigned in 1594 with elements from the Weser Renaissance. Subsequent changes were regularly made, such as, for example, the ostentatious neo-Baroque doorway with a flight of stairs that was only added in the 19th century. Above the doorway you can read the well-known quote by the mayor of Bremen, writer and journalist Otto Gildermeister. Buden und Binnen, Wagen und Winnen. The literal translation is... Outside and in, dare and win. This describes the daring nature, risk and profit of Bremen's trade within Germany, Binnen and overseas, Buten. Above the lower windows you can see the coat of arms of the Hanseatic cities of Hamburg and Lübeck and the Hanseatic contours of Bergen, Brugge, London and Novgorod. During the Second World War all but the outer walls of the Schütting were burnt down and it was then rebuilt within these old outer walls. Some more background information for coffee lovers. One of the first coffee houses in German-speaking countries opened in 1697 in Schütting. Now follow the Nagelroute, which follows along the left side of the Schütting through the Schüttingstrasse and walk to the entrance of the Bütcherstrasse to see the golden relief. 8. Bütcherstrasse. Locations in turn. In front of the Golden Relief, Handwerkerhof, and the Glockenspiel. Shining above the entrance to Bütcherstrasse is the golden relief plate entitled Der Lichtbringer by the artist Bernhard Hütke from Forbeswede. The relief marks the entrance to a street which was created from 1922 to 1931 when Germany was still reeling from its humiliating defeat in the First World War. Coffee merchant Ludwig Roselius financed the new buildings of this street to symbolize a renewal of Germany from low German-Anglo-Saxon tradition. The Lichtbringer was created in 1936 after the street with its architecture, in particular the abstract brick relief above the street entrance, which is no longer visible today, had become the target of National Socialist propaganda. It portrays the battle between the Archangel Michael and the Dragon of Hell, interpreted as a triumph of divine power over the demonic Kingdom of Darkness. You have now arrived in the 110-meter long secret main street of Bremen. The renowned pedestrian passage of the Bütcherstrasse is regarded as a synonym for lifestyle. Before you continue, have a look up at the building in front of you. High above, on the right-hand side of the gable, you will recognize the sandstone figures of the so-called Seven Lazy Brothers. The Seven Lazy Brothers are figures of a well-known Bremen fable by Bremen folktales writer Friedrich Wagenfeld. There were once seven brothers who were too lazy to fetch water from the river Weser. So they built a well and laid pipelines. Nor could they be bothered to pull their wheelbarrows out of the mud or to go to the forest to collect wood. So they paved the streets and planted trees. What do you think? Is this laziness or innovation? Decide for yourself. Now walk a little way along the street until you discover the Handwerkerhof craft center on the left. The Bütcherstrasse was once the narrow street of the Bötigmacher, barrel makers and coopers. During the Middle Ages, the street was an important connection between the market square and the Weser. When the harbour and all of its contract suppliers were relocated in the mid-19th century, the Bütcherstrasse went into decline. Another two artworks by Hütger adorn the Handwerkerhof. A bust of Ludwig Roselius, Bremen coffee merchant and inventor of the first decaffeinated coffee, Café Haag, and a well by the Seven Lazy Brothers, who are highlighted again here. Right next to the Handwerkerhof craft center is the Paula Modersohn Becker Museum, the first museum in the world which was dedicated to the work of an artist. Paintings from all creative phases of the most renowned German painter prove her outstanding significance as a pioneer of modern painting around 1900. Continue following the Nagelroute until you reach the Glockenspiel. Can you perhaps hear the sound of bells ringing? Then you're in luck! From May to December, every hour on the hour, between 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock, the 30 Meissner porcelain bells chime between the gables, and have done ever since 1934. And the house of the Glockenspiel on the neighboring tower displays ten carved and painted wooden panels depicting ocean conquerors and aviation pioneers by sculptor Bernhard Hütger. Ludwig Roselius paid tribute to bridge builders between Europe and America, such as, for example, Viking Leif Erikson, discoverer Christopher Columbus, the aeronaut Graf Zeppelin, or the crew of the Bremen, which was the first airplane to cross the Atlantic non-stop in an east-west direction, and is nowadays exhibited at the Bremen airport. Please continue your tour and continue walking along the Böttcherstrasse until you come to the aquarium, a few meters behind the Glockenspiel Square on the right-hand side. If you'd like to take a breather, sit on the bench. Between the years 1922 to 1931, Roselius redesigned the Böttcherstrasse into a complete work of art and gradually bought the seven houses on the street. Every house has its own name. The main architects were Alfred Runge, Edward Scotland, and Bernhard Hütger. Hütger designed the Paula Modesson Becker House and the Atlantis House, in which today the Hilton Hotel and the impressive Blue White Heaven Hall can be found. Opposite this, you will see the Robinson Crusoe House. The writer, Daniel Defoe, felt a connection to the city of Bremen and declared his novel's hero, Robinson Crusoe, as the son of a Bremen merchant. Badly damaged during the Second World War, the facades of the houses on the Böttcherstrasse were already rebuilt by the year 1954, mostly with funding from the Café Haag company. Nowadays, the tradition-steeped Böttcherstrasse, with its unusual architecture, is a little handicraft paradise, with small shops, gastronomy, the Bremen Casino, museums and workshops. Hütger designed the traditional red-brick architecture of the passage with Art Nouveau and Art Deco elements. The street's art collections include the museum in the Roselius House and the Paula Modesson Becker Museum and form the architectural and cultural highlight of the Böttcherstrasse. Now, please follow the markings through the underpass to the Weser Promenade by the river. Here you will see the ship jetty, which is known as the Martini landing stage. 9. Martini Church landing stage Location, Weser Schlachter Promenade below the Martini Church at the Martini Landing Stage kiosk. The Martini Landing Stage below the Martini Church is the landing stage of the passenger and cruise vessels on the Weser Schlachter Promenade. Get to know the maritime side of Bremen and embark on a Weser and harbour tour on historic or modern ships. You can also travel from here to Wegesack in the north. And it's only 60 kilometres downstream from here to Bremerhaven. Walk a few steps along the ship landing stage. The historic Evangelical St. Martini Church, which gave the landing stage its name, soars in the direction of the old town. It is the smallest, youngest and also most picturesque of the total of four old Bremen parish churches and was initially built as a three-aisled basilica around the year 1229. In the 14th century, it was extended into a hall church. Around two centuries later, a vicarage was built, the Neanderhaus. This was named after Joachim Neander, who lived in the house and wrote the world-famous church hymn, Praise to the Lord. Incidentally, the Neanderthal valley was named after him and this is where the remains of the earliest human species were later found. The late Gothic red brick building was badly damaged during the Second World War, but then rebuilt again in the post-war period. Relax a little by the Weser and enjoy the maritime flair in the traditional harbour and trading city of Bremen. We would also like to tell you a bit about the life around the river and the Weser Schlachterpromenade. 10. Schlachte, location Weser Schlachte Promenade And what actually is the Schlachte you may be asking? This is the name for the built-out bank of the river Weser that served as a landing place and which was constructed as far back as the year 1250 using driven-in wooden posts and wattle work. The name Schlachte itself is derived from the Low German word Schlagte which comes from the German word Schlagen, to hit. From around the year 1200 the Schlachte formed the main Bremen harbour. However, the siltation of the Weser and increasing loaded draft of the ships meant that as early as the 16th century the larger ships were no longer able to use the Schlachte. Then, in the year 1623, by order of the Bremen town council, architect Jakob Claussen finished off his work on one of the first artificial seaports in Germany, the harbour of Wegesack in the north of Bremen. The harbour's period of prosperity lasted until 1820, as due to the siltation it also became possible for larger ships to reach Wegesack. This made the founding of another harbour necessary. In the year 1827 the former mayor Johann Schmidt bought a piece of land in Lower Saxony on which to build a harbour at the mouth of the river Weser. This developed into a promising sea harbour, which is the Bremerhaven we know today, and which as a consolidation of the Lower Weser towns of Bremerhaven, Leher, Geestermunde, was temporarily called Wesermunde. By doing this, Schmidt enabled Bremen free access to the sea. Little roads used to lead from the old town to the Schlachte, the so-called Schlachtgates. The Schlachte was situated outside of the city walls and could only be reached through the Schlachtgates. The first, second and last gates are still marked on maps of the city today and have been retained as street names. The rebuilding and redesigning of the Schlachte promenade began on the banks of the river as part of the Expo 2000, with its motto, People, Nature, Technology. The people of Bremen rediscovered their city by the river. Today the Schlachte is the scene of pulsating city life. Whether watching the ships, strolling, laughing and enjoying, eating, drinking or celebrating parties, the Schlachte is simply a fun place to be. In fine weather, the terraces and gardens of a variety of different international restaurants and cafes are the ideal place to enjoy the views over the water and the historic and modern ships. At the Schlachte you can also admire the Kog ship, a replica of the historic Hanseatic vessel from the 13th and 14th centuries, or the three-masted frigate Admiral Nelson, a rustic pancake ship which is anchored right opposite the Martini church. Every Saturday in the summer season you can browse the stalls at the Cajun market along the Weser promenade for antique and useful items. In the advent period, the Schlachte magic market takes place against a historic, wintry and maritime backdrop. Now return to the markings on the ground, which run along the left side of the kiosk at the Martini landing stage at the underpass, and walk on a short distance along the left of the Weser in a south-easterly direction. You will pass by the theatre ship and along the arcades. International trade, harbours and shipping, and quality products from highly modern industries characterize the economic life in Bremen. Products from the Bremen grocery and luxury food product industry in particular, such as wine, beer, tea, chocolate, sausage and meat products, fish, cereals, or tropical fruits, for example, have made a name for themselves all around the world. And also, 50% of the coffee drunk in Germany passes through the harbour of Bremen. On the opposite side of the Weser, you can also see the building of the German lifeboat institution, which is based here in Bremen. This was founded in 1865, is financed by donations, and serves as an emergency headquarters for ships in distress at sea. Right next to it, also on the other side of the Weser, the building of the former waterworks. It looks like an upside-down chest of drawers, and was the first waterworks in Bremen. The historic water tower, which is over 100 years old, was earlier used to ensure the required water pressure in the city's water supply for the Bremen population. Continue following the markings on the pavement and leave the Weser behind. Cross through the underpass and go up the steps on the right. Now, walk on a short distance along the street. Turn left onto the street Hinter der Holzpforte, and immerse yourself in a world of a very special Bremen quarter. Now continue on to the small square in front of the Geschichtenhaus. Please press the pause button until you reach the square. 11. Schnoor Locations Wüsterstätte, Schnoor, Staffendam, corner of Kölpinkstraße and St. Johann Church Now you have arrived in Bremen's oldest preserved quarter, the Schnoor. In 1959, the Schnoor quarter was the first larger group of buildings in Germany to be recognized as a historic monument worth protecting. Join us on an idyllic journey back in time. You are now in the so-called Wüsterstätte, deserted place. This is a small, picturesque square reminiscent of the area that lay waste after the 17th century fire. On the left side, the Bremen Story House awaits its visitors. Costumed actors, dressed up as famous historic people from Bremen, will transport you and all of your senses back in time to Bremen's past. Further along the markings through the narrow alleys, you will now see the wedding house on the right-hand side at Schnoor No. 5. In the Middle Ages, couples who came to Bremen from the countryside were only allowed to marry in the city cathedral if they could prove they also had an abode there. This is where the wedding houses came in. The green half-timbered house is linked to this tradition and with a total of 43 square meters, is one of the smallest hotels in the world. If you'd like to test out this cozy wedding house for yourself, here's the good news. Nowadays, it can also be rented for two people. You can really relax in this marital abode over three small floors with its own whirlpool and four-poster bed below the roof. And these days, it's not only married couples who can enjoy it. Now, please cross the narrow alley and turn left into the Schnoor Street. Walk down the street along the markings until you come to a small square while continuing to listen. Have a look around you and soak up this picturesque setting. This street gave the smallest district of Bremen its name. But where does the name Schnoor come from, you may be asking. Look along the houses. Do you notice anything? Schnoor is Low German and means Schnur, the word for string, as here the small and lovingly restored houses from the 15th and 16th centuries are set close together like a string of pearls, which follow the course of the Balger, the former weiser distributory. The so-called Stavendamm on the small square was named after the Staven, the medieval public baths. In particular, the fountain, which you can see here, is reminiscent of this place of hygiene. However, the bath houses were not only used for bathing. It is said that men and women also used them as places of immoral activity. Now let's walk along the markings past the café until the next corner at the Gasthof. Stay standing on this corner for a moment. In the Kolpingstraße on the right-hand side, you will notice a very new orange-coloured building complex, the Burgitten Monastery with Guesthouse, Cloistered Area and Chapel. It was constructed between 2001 and 2002 as the first monastery building in Bremen since the Middle Ages and is made up of three connecting structures. Now walk left along the markings and down the street Lange Wierung. St. Johann Church In front of you now is the St. Johann Church, which was built by the Franciscans from the 14th century. It is the only Catholic church in Bremen's centre and also houses a private school. Nowadays, the majority of people in Bremen are Protestants. Only 12% are Catholic. Notice the simple design and the two corner towers. There is no grand church tower rising up into the sky. This is due to the fact that it was originally the Franciscan monastery which used the church. After being used for different purposes, it has served as a Catholic place of worship again since 1823. If you have the time to view the interior of the Gothic Hall Church, you will find a modern and simple design there too. Now it's time to leave the Schnoor Quarter. Follow the markings and use the steps. Or, if you prefer to avoid the steps, there is another alternative. All you have to do is walk back down the street and take two left turns. You will come to the tram junction Domsheide, a large crossroads. Please cross the road carefully and watch out for the trams and buses. Follow the markings on the ground in the direction of the cathedral and cross over the tram tracks again. When you have reached the cathedral, please look for a suitable place with a view of the statue on the front side. 12. St. Peter's Cathedral. Location, between the Cathedral and Town Hall. Direction of view, front side with the main entrance of the Cathedral. 1,200 years. This is the proud age of the magnificent St. Peter's Cathedral in Brayman, with its enthralling history, which you are standing in front of right now. Here, on the natural and highest point of a sand dune, around 10 metres above flood level, is where the Diocese of Brayman was founded. On the left side of the right Cathedral doorway, you will see the namesake, Patrus. The Holy Apostle, St. Patrus, is the patron of the Brayman Cathedral, and in the coat of arms of the old Brayman Diocese, holds a key, which represents the key to Heaven. The central figure is the founder, Emperor Charles the Great, who is holding a model of the Cathedral. Charles the Great consecrated the English missionary, Villahad, as a missionary bishop in the year 787. On the elevation of the dunes, on which Brayman originated, in 789, Bishop Villahad erected the prototype of the Cathedral, a small wooden church, which was, however, destroyed shortly afterwards. A few days later, Villahad died at the age of 44 years old. His mortal remains can be found as relics in the Cathedral. From 1072 to 1101, Archbishop Limar ultimately called for the construction of a Romanic Cathedral as a three-aisled pillar basilica with two crypts. The Romanesque-style West Crypt, which was still completed under his predecessor, Adalbert, in 1066, forms the oldest preserved part of the Cathedral today. There were regular additions, alterations, and renovations way into the 20th century. Now have a glance up at the mighty towers, which soar up to a height of 98 meters. The two-tower front was constructed in the 13th century and ensured that the Cathedral retained its early Gothic character. Sweden annexed the Archbishopric of Brayman after the Thirty Years' War, and so the Cathedral and the former Cathedral immunity became Swedish and subsequently Hanoverian. Only in 1803 did the Cathedral area fall back into the hands of the city of Brayman. For almost the entire 19th century the Cathedral went to rack and ruin with the half-collapsed South Tower. Only from 1888 onwards did an extensive, improving as well as historically distorting restoration begin, following the ideas of the Cathedral architect Max Salzmann. The Cathedral was barely affected by the bombing in the Second World War. In the 1970s, underfloor heating was to be installed, but during the building work numerous Archbishops' graves were exposed and significant findings were made. The Cathedral Museum in the Evangelical St. Peter's Cathedral shows the restored discoveries, like the altar furnishings, sacred scriptures, stone sculptures, textiles and mural paintings. In an adjacent building of the Brayman Cathedral is also the Lead Cellar, in which you can view eight mummified bodies and relics from the cloister of the Cathedral. You can reach the Lead Cellar via the so-called Bible Garden. Perhaps you have heard of the writer Freiherr von Knigge, best remembered for his book On Human Relations. His final resting place can be found inside the nave. And in case you want to give your ears a treat, every Thursday evening in the Cathedral superb concerts are offered, with free entry featuring organ, chamber or choir music by Johann Sebastian Bach for example. To the left of the doorway you cannot miss the equestrian monument of the former Reich Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. This is a piece of work by renowned sculptor Adolf von Hildebrand. By 1871, the year the Reich was founded, Bismarck had already been elected as an honorary citizen of Brayman, and is portrayed here in a riding pose. Among the German Bismarck monuments this is a big exception. Generally speaking, equestrian statues had always been reserved for monarchs. 13. Town Musicians Location, Between the Town Hall and the Church of Our Beloved Lady Another Bremen landmark and popular photo location for tourists, the Town Musicians of Bremen. This fairy tale has made Bremen famous all over the world. Spare a moment to look at the bronze sculpture by Professor Gerhard Marx on the west side of the Town Hall from the year 1951. Back then, Marx specifically chose this place. Is this what you imagined the Town Musicians to look like? Many tourists say, my, aren't they small? But size isn't everything. The traditional fairy tale of the Town Musicians was already well known in the 12th century. After all, the story written by the Brothers Grimm was entitled The Bremen Town Musicians. Close your eyes and think back to how the tale goes. We are going to Bremen. You can find something better than death everywhere, said the donkey to the rooster, and suggested traveling to Bremen to become Town Musicians. The four animals, donkey, dog, cat, and rooster, are too old to be useful to their owners and fear being killed. The animals are able to escape this grisly fate and bump into each other by chance. The donkey suggests becoming Town Musicians in Bremen. So, the animals set off on their journey to Bremen together. It is not possible, however, to reach the city in the same day, so they have to spend the night in the woods. There, the four journeymen come across a robber's house where they scare and drive away the robbers with trickery and loud bellowing. As the Bremen Town Musicians like the house so much, they don't want to leave, so that is where they happily spend the rest of their days. In the 13th century, Bremen, as an aspiring trading town, allowed merchants to come to the city, and with them also came jugglers and musicians. The city council allowed the Town Musicians to play music at festivals and from the top of the tower, and these Town Musicians always picked up other traveling musicians on their way, just like in the fairy tale. But what is actually behind the vibrant story of the four animals? For us, the moral of the fairy tale is that only by acting together can the weak prevail over the strong. Strength comes in numbers. Now it's your turn. It's not only Bremen's residents who are allowed to make a wish by touching both forelegs of the donkey with both hands, but please don't touch it with one hand, otherwise one donkey will say to another, good day, as one says in Bremen. You can make one wish that will then come true. That's a promise. But we can't actually predict when this will happen. Of course, you cannot tell anyone what you have wished for. Stroking the donkey's nose will also bring you good luck. This monument of the Bremen Town Musicians by Gerhard Marx is the most renowned of all interpretations. Gerhard Marx was one of the most important German sculptors of the 20th century. When he was still alive in 1971, Bremen devoted a museum to Marx, the Gerhard Marx House, which accommodates the Gerhard Marx Foundation. Incidentally, there are figures of the town musicians everywhere in Bremen. Just have a look around to see how many you can discover.
