Stroll along the Weser and enjoy one of the many local beer gardens.\nSummer-Feeling and Relaxation\nEspecially during summer, the Schlachte is a popular get-together for Bremen residents and visitors of all generations. The first Sunday in March is traditionally the opening of the season for the summer gardens and beer gardens on the Schlachte. From here and also during walks up to the Osterdeich or in the direction of \u00dcberseestadt, you can enjoy the wonderful atmosphere on the Weser. You can let your gaze wander over the river and have a great view of the many adjacent ships, such as the legendary Alexander von Humboldt.\n\nMagical Winter\nEven in the cold season, the Schlachte does not lose its very special charm: in December, the annual Schlachte Magic casts its wintry and mystical spell on its visitors. At this very special Christmas market you can expect treats, arts and crafts, jugglers, pure entertainment and a very magical atmosphere. As dusk falls, the historical maritime medieval market is bathed in atmospheric blue light. And the adjacent ships will also shine in festive lighting. You can hear the vendors haggling over every penny, while the scent of spices, sweet and savoury food tickles your nostrils and mead, mocha or hot apples warm your heart in the freezing temperatures.\n\n\nThe Schlachte - Past and Present\nThe term \"\"Schlachte\"\", first mentioned in a document in 1250, goes back to the Low German word \"\"Slait\"\" and referres to the pile-like structures used to reinforce the banks of the Weser in the 13th century. For many centuries, maritime trade flourished and even in old harbour times there were many taverns and hostels on the Schlachte. They were mainly frequented by the dock workers and served as a meeting place for wages until the increasing silting up of the Middle and Lower Weser put an end to the hustle and bustle at the riverside harbour in the late 19th century. It was not until Expo 2000 that the Schlachte was completely redesigned. A great fortune for the people of the city and its visitors, who can now enjoy the maritime flair of the Weser promenade to the full.\n\"\n", "\"Like Pearls on a String\nThe Old Town quarter owes its name \"\"Schnoor\"\" to the Low German word for \"\"string\"\", and there's no better way to describe this lovingly restored district: Here, small, colourful houses and shops line up like pearls on a string, along alleys so narrow that you can touch both sides with outstretched arms. No wonder, then, that the US newspaper New York Post ranks the unique streets of the Schnoor among the \"\"coolest\"\" in the world.A Must-Visit!\nToday, the Schnoor is a thriving part of the city of Bremen. The quarter is a sight in itself, but if you're looking for a cosy caf\u00e9 or arts and crafts, this is also the place to be. In addition, the Schnoor is also home to a museum - the Bremer Geschichtenhaus - a quaint little \"\"wedding house\"\" to stay in for newlyweds or lovers, and a small theatre, the Packhaustheater.\n The Schnoor is also home to the story of Bremen's original Heini Holtenbeen, the Birgitten Monastery, the only monastery in the city, and the Katzengang, probably one of the narrowest streets in the world.Shopping and Enjoyment Seven Days a Week\nA variety of small buisinesses invite you to rummage and shop in the unique atmosphere of the 111 pretty little houses in the Schnoor. While normally you can't go shopping on Sundays in Germany, here it is possible from April to and including December. Many art shops, galleries and souvenir shops are also open on the seventh day of the week.\nIn addition to jewellery, souvenirs and many other specialities, you will also find a whole range of Bremen specialities in the Schnoor. Some restaurants will spoil you with local dishes like labskaus, knipp or brown cabbage, and bakeries, confectioners and caf\u00e9s will sweeten your day with sugary treats like Bremer Kluten, Schnoorkuller, Kaffeebrot, Klaben or Babbeler. A very special highlight is the colourful candy workshop of the Bremer Bonbon Manufaktur in the Materburg. Here you can watch confectioners lovingly making fudge, marshmallows and of course candies, or even take part in a workshop yourself.The History of the Schnoor\nThe Schnoor was first mentioned in the 13th century. It was mainly river fishermen, craftsmen and tradesmen who lived in this quarter. \nThe oldest buildings that have survived to the present day were built in the 14th century. At that time, a Franciscan monastery was also built on the edge of today's Schnoorviertel, of which only the church remains today. It bears the name St. Johann and is one of the main sights in the Schnoor. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Schnoor developed into a poor quarter due to its lack of space, as cars, for example, could not pass through its alleys. What was perceived as a nightmare at the time is what gives the quarter its special ambience today. The car-free quarter is a wonderful place to stroll and immerse oneself for a moment in times long past. The medieval half-timbering of the more than 100 listed houses, the ancient cobblestones and the unique atmosphere of the winding alleyways make visitors forget the stress of everyday life in no time at all.\nWhere to find the Schnoorviertel\nSomewhat hidden, but still right in the centre of Bremen, you'll find the special gem that is Schnoor. From the heart of the city with its market square, world heritage town hall and Roland statue, St. Petri's Cathedral and the Bremen Town Musicians, the tranquil quarter is only a few metres away and within walking distance. Just stroll in the direction of Domsheide. From there, you can access the Schnoorviertel from the street \"\"Lange Wieren\"\" or take the path via \"\"Dechanatstra\u00dfe\"\" and \"\"Am Landherrnamt\"\". A little further in the direction of Ostertor, Komturstra\u00dfe or Materburg will take you to your destination. Towards the Weser, you will find the other end of the \"\"Marterburg\"\", which will also take you directly to the Schnoor.\"\n", "\"lowing through the heart of Bremen is the Weser river: an old trading route that was the driving force behind the city's emergence as a proud Hanseatic centre.

Enjoy a cruise through the harbour or book a boat trip to Bremerhaven, marvel at world famous sailing vessels, feast on board a maritime restaurant or spend a night in a cozy cabin.\n\n1Alexander von Humboldt\nThis historical three-masted ship, which gained international recognition through commercials for Beck's beer, was being rebuilt into a floating restaurant and hotel. It anchors permanently at the Schlachte in Bremen. The Alexander von Humboldt served as a sail training ship until it was brought out of service in 2011. Its new owner had refurbished it completely and converted it into a hotel and restaurant business, but kept its distinctive green sails. Now, the barque, which was built in 1906, offers a unique accommodation for forty people, mainly in twin rooms but also in larger family rooms. The Alexander von Humboldt offers a different menu every month with a selection of fresh, regional and seasonal dishes. These also refer to the ship and its voyages. A selection of wines and other drinks are available to complement the food. The ship can accommodate small private parties and larger functions for up to 120 guests.\n\nDas Schiff Alexander von Humboldt am Anleger vor der Martinikirche am Abend\nAlexander von Humboldt an der Schlachte\n\n\u00a9 Francesco Carovillano / DZT Deutsche Zentrale f\u00fcr Tourismus e.V.\n2Dauerwelle\nThe Dauerwelle was purchased by the University of the Arts in 2020 and lovingly refurbished at the K\u00f6tter shipyard and the Lankenauer H\u00f6ft. In May 2022, the converted passenger ship celebrated its christening and since then has been available for exhibitions, projects and events. The perm is intended to serve as a special meeting place for science, culture and society.\n\nDas Schiff \"\"Dauerwelle\"\" auf der Weser in Bremen.

After the Senate decommissioned the ship, an association of Bremen merchants took over the launch in order to make it accessible to Bremen's citizens and the business community at Schlachte jetty 6. Since then, companies and private individuals have been able to charter the MS Senator for celebrations and parties for up to 37 people.\n\nDie MS Senator an ihrem Anleger an der Schlachte\n\u00a9 privat / JUA\n5MS Friedrich\nThe MS Friedrich is the oldest ship still in service on the Weser. Built in Hamburg in 1880, the former steamship was sold to Bremen as early as 1918, where it was initially used as a working ferry. In 1925, the Friedrich was not only given her current name, she also began operating as the \"\"Great Harbour Tour\"\", taking her passengers through Bremen's free ports. Numerous different areas of operation followed until the MS Friedrich was taken over by an association whose mission was to preserve it. Renovated, the ship is now moored at the Schlachte, undertakes regular club trips and is available to the public for cultural events.\n\nDie MS Friedrich an ihrem Anleger an der Schlachte.\n\u00a9 bremen.online /JUA\n6Nedeva\nHenry Ford, Barbara Hutton or J.P. Morgan - in the 1930s, the Nedeva was a popular meeting place for New York's high society and stood more than ever for glamour and the spirit of optimism after the Great Depression of 1929. The motor yacht, built by the New York Yacht Launch and Engine Company, belonged to the investment banker Edward Townsend Stotesbury, who regularly invited the celebrities of his time to parties and tours. Today, the Nedeva is once again an event location and can be booked for celebrations of all kinds.\n\nEine Yacht liegt vor Anker an der Weser\n\u00a9 bremen.online GmbH/ Foto: mdr\n7MS Oceana\nBuilt in 1937 at the Atlas works, the passenger ship MS Oceana has always been at home on the Weser. The ship, which is licensed for a maximum of 700 people, awaits its passengers at the Martinianleger for regular scheduled trips. From Martinianleger via Pier 2, Mittelsb\u00fchren, Vegesack, Blumenthal, Farge, Brake, Nordenham Unionpapier to Bremerhaven Seeb\u00e4derkaje and back - on the MS Oceana you can explore the varied landscape from Bremen to Bremerhaven from the water from May to September. At the many stops, you have the opportunity to get off the ship and discover what's on offer at the various piers. It is also possible to take bicycles along, so you can combine your ship tour with a bicycle tour. In addition, the Oceana is available for charter trips.\n\nBlick auf den Martinianleger mit der MS Oceana und Menschen an der abendlichen Weserpromenade Schlachte \n\u00a9 WFB/Jonas Ginter\n8Pannekoekschip Admiral Nelson\nThe Admiral Nelson is moored at Schlachte Pier 1 - a faithful replica of a frigate with which the famous British Admiral Horatio Nelson once won high-profile naval battles. Also known as the Pannekoekship, the restaurant ship invites you to dine and drink in a 'piratical' atmosphere. There are plenty of seats available both below and on deck. On the menu are soups, salads, sundaes, cakes and of course numerous pancake dishes from sweet to savoury.\n\nEin Schiff liegt an der Schlachte und die Sonne geht langsam unter.\n\u00a9 WFB/Tank\n9Theaterschiff\nAt Weser Pier 4, in the immediate vicinity of the Wilhelm-Kaisen Bridge, the Theaterschiff awaits its guests with varied and laugh-out-loud comedies, revues and cabarets. In two theatre halls, which were set up in the former hold of the converted barge, there is space for a total of 216 spectators. On the deck, a gastronomic offer provides for culinary delights. The location is also available for private parties.\n\nEin Schiff an der Weser, in dem ein Theater untergebracht ist.\n\n10Die Weser\nYou can spend the night in a maritime atmosphere on a replica of the Weser paddle steamer \"\"Die Weser\"\".

The MS Treue is permanently moored at the beginning of the Schlachte (jetty Tiefer 3).\n\nEin Blick vom Weserufer auf die Weser.

Half sunk, doomed to be scrapped and left to decay - the 72-metre-long windjammer faced its end several times until it was bought by Eduard van der Velden in 2003, brought to Bremen and rebuilt on his own.\n\nEin Schiff in der Weser liegt an einem Steg an.\n\n13Aventura\nSince spring 2022, visitors have been able to find the well-preserved Aventura from 1938 at Schlachte. The ship is the new home of the sailing school \"\"Watt voraus\"\". Here, in cosy lounges, you can study for your sailing licence, among other things. Parties and celebrations are not neglected on the Aventura either, as the ship can also be used as an event location. Visitors can also spend the night in one of the cosy cabins.\n\nDie Flaniermeile \"\"Schlachte\"\" an der Weser bei Sonnenuntergang.

Although the old lady ship is no longer the youngest, she still has a lot to offer. Today, the MS Loretta serves as a stylish event location. A varied programme of music, theatre, literature and art is regularly offered on board.\n\nDas Schiff \"\"MS Loretta\"\" auf der Weser in Bremen.

The classically elegant ship once came to beautiful Bremen from southern Germany and has been used here ever since to reinforce the service, as well as on harbour tours and for events.\n\"\n", "\"Donkeys, dogs, cats and roosters are as much a part of Bremen as the Weser. And they literally accompany you every step of the way in the old town. Discover the Bremen Town \nThe most famous landmark of the Hanseatic city is the Bremen Town Musicians. A bronze statue by Gerhard Marcks has been commemorating the popular fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm since 1953 in the heart of Bremen. According to the story, a donkey, dog, cat and rooster once set off for the city on the Weser to find a better life.Where are the Bremen Town Musicians?\nSmall but mighty - hardly any saying is more apt for the bronze sculpture of the Town Musicians than this one. Gerhard Marcks' animals are not life-sized at two meters, but are all the more popular with Bremen residents and visitors. The city's landmark can be found from the market square on the left, western side of the town hall. If you follow the street \"\"Schoppensteel\"\", which leads from the Our Lady's Churchyard towards the Domshof, you can't miss the figure at all.A portion of luck\nIf you have found the Bremen Town Musicians, you will notice the donkey's bare front legs. The reason for this is that it is said to bring good luck to hold the legs. So if you are already there, you should not miss the opportunity to make a wish to the donkey or simply to take a portion of luck with you. But be careful! If you only hold one leg, you will immediately be exposed as a Bremen layman. Because then, as they say here, one donkey shakes hands with the other.Cosmopolitanism has a tradition in Bremen\nThe Town Musicians once set off for Bremen in search of a secure future. The hope of a good life in the beautiful Weser city is not only shared by the current but also by numerous people who have come to Bremen from all parts of Germany and the world. In the tradition of a cosmopolitan Hanseatic city, Bremen sees immigration as an enrichment and has an active culture of welcome.\n\nThis cosmopolitanism has also carried the Town Musicians to other countries around the world, because in addition to the bronze statue at the town hall, there are many other depictions of the world-famous animals.\"\n", "FAHRPLANER\nSearch for routes and book your ticket.

The museum's buildings form a unique ensemble in a spacious park: the transparent main building, the cubic display storeroom and the four historic houses from different eras. The mill in Oberneuland is also part of the Focke Museum.\n\nThe Focke Museum, which is over 100 years old, is characterized by the variety of themes on display. From the Stone Age to the 20th century, original objects tell of Bremen's past and cultural history.\n\nThe themes of the permanent exhibitions range from the city's history to shipping and trade, industry and work, rural life and bourgeois living culture, applied and fine art, Bremen silver and European glass, and archaeology. Children's lives and historical toys can be seen in the interactive children's museum.\n\nPlease note: The Focke Museum is renewing its collection exhibition on the city's history. Due to renovation work and the redesign of the exhibition, the main building and the exhibition storeroom will be closed until the end of 2026. \n\nOpening hours:\nTue-Sun: 10am\u20135pm\n\nGuided tours for school classes by appointment and Tue\u2013Fri: from 9am\nAddress:\nFoundation under public law\nSchwachhauser Heerstr. 240\n28213 Bremen\nContact:\nTelephone: +49 (0)421 699 600 - 0", "Bremen for Night Owls\nThere are many things to experience in Bremen by night: going on a pub tour with friends in the 'Viertel' district, enjoying an evening out in a stylish bar, or dancing the night away at a trendy club on the 'disco mile'.\nWhether wild dance nights in a large disco, hearty pub evenings in a rustic ambience or cocktails with a lounge feeling - Bremen's nightlife has something to suit every taste!\nThe Viertel - The Place to be for Pub Crawlers\nThe quarter comprises the Ostertor and Steintor districts and is \"THE\" trendy quarter of Bremen.

Special programs for children on the topic of childhood and youth during National Socialism provide a look at the Nazi era from the personal memories of contemporary witnesses from Bremen.

The Mayor of Bremerhaven is also a regular participant in this meeting. The room's carpet consists of a total of 19 million knots and depicts the Bremen Key; a faithful replica of the original carpet cost 110,000 euros.\"\n", "the original function of the two subsequent floors has also been retained until today. The upper floor was reserved for representation, and the ground floor was intended for use by the \"\"market people\"\", today all citizens. Thus the population was joined with the authority - a function that has been retained until today and another reason to enlist the Town Hall on the World Heritage List.\n\nUNESCO also sees the special importance of the Bremen Town Hall in its artistic and stylistic values: today its main fa\u00e7ade represents the so-called Weser Renaissance and is considered a highly representative example of this style. The medieval attributes of this building - such as the emblematic sculptural decoration in sandstone - remained at their original position. It is also to be underlined that the Bremen Town Hall reflects European-wide trends at the end of the 16th and early 17th centuries.\n\nThe Bremen Town Hall was expressly built for the use of the City Council. The architecture and the sculptures do not only carry strong references to the imperial and Episcopal foundations of the city, but at the same time underline the policies of self-government, which had been chosen by the Council. The construction of the Town Hall demonstrated grown self-confidence of the city council and its civic claim to power.\n\nThe Bremen stone Roland, erected in 1404, is 5.5 metres tall and one of the oldest and most representative roland statues, which were once erected on marketplaces in Central Europe as a symbol of freedom and market rights. It is referred to a historical figure, paladin of Emperor Charlemagne. The Bremen Roland is to underline: the Emperor is the founder of the city, it was him who has given the city its rights and privileges. The Roland and the Town Hall of Bremen are part of humanity's world heritage as they bear a unique testimony to civic autonomy and sovereignty as these developed in Europe over the centuries. The symbolism of the Town Hall and the Roland reflects the autonomous status of the Bremen city state until today.\"\n"], "ids": ["id0", "id1", "id2", "id3", "id4", "id5", "id6", "id7", "id8", "id9", "id10", "id11", "id12", "id13", "id14", "id15", "id16", "id17", "id18", "id19", "id20", "id21", "id22", "id23", "id24", "id25", "id26", "id27"]}
